can u plz remove the rededust config?
based what i found is the server rededust currently offline
here is what i found this fking brazil server : https://vi.namemc.com/server/rededust.com

EVIDENCE!

max player is 700, but there are 0 of them, and no one has been joined
the ip of the server it said "Can't Connect To Server"

CURRENT CONFIG : REDEDUST
issue is
1 : this config might almost use vanilla, but the disabler inside of it is nothing
2 : ping spoof make lag too much can cause me rubberbanding
3 : config may outdated, i seeking that no one has been update this config
